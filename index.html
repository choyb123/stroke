			<td>High blood pressure is a huge factor, doubling or even quadrupling your stroke risk if it is not controlled. High blood pressure is the biggest contributor to the risk of stroke in both men and women. Monitoring blood pressure and, if it is elevated, treating it, is probably the biggest difference people can make to their vascular health.

Your ideal goal: Maintain a blood pressure of less than 120/80 if possible. For some older people, this might not be possible because of medication side effects or dizziness with standing.</td>
<td>Reduce the salt in your diet, ideally to no more than 1,500 milligrams a day (about a half teaspoon).
Increase polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats in your diet, while avoiding foods high in saturated fats.
Eat 4 to 5 cups of fruits and vegetables every day, one serving of fish two to three times a week, and several daily servings of whole grains and low-fat dairy.
Get more exercise â€” at least 30 minutes of activity a day, and more, if possible.
Quit smoking, if you smoke.</td>
